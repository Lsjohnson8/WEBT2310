            <h2>Cage Diving</h2>
            <p>Shark cage diving is an exhilarating experience that allows participants to observe sharks up close in their natural habitat while remaining protected within a metal cage. The adventure typically begins with a boat ride to a location known for shark activity, where professional guides provide safety instructions and information about the sharks you'll encounter. Once anchored, participants are equipped with wetsuits, snorkels, or scuba gear, depending on the depth and duration of the dive. After entering the cage, which is securely attached to the boat, you're lowered into the water where bait, known as chum, may be used to attract sharks. Visitors can expect to see species like great white, tiger, or reef sharks swimming just feet away from the cage. Safety is the top priority, and it's essential to follow all rules, such as keeping hands and feet inside the cage at all times, avoiding sudden movements that could attract sharks, and listening closely to the dive operators' instructions. While exhilarating, the experience is designed to be safe and educational, allowing participants to appreciate the beauty and power of sharks while supporting conservation efforts through responsible tourism.</p>

                <h2>Free Diving</h2>
                <p>Shark free diving is an intense and thrilling experience where divers swim freely alongside sharks without the protection of a cage. This experience is only recommended for experienced divers, as it requires comfort in the water and knowledge of shark behavior. Free dives often take place in areas known for non-aggressive shark species like reef sharks, nurse sharks, or whale sharks, although species like tiger or bull sharks may also be encountered under the supervision of experts. Before the dive, participants receive a detailed briefing on shark behavior, safety protocols, and how to interact respectfully with the animals. Key rules include staying calm, maintaining steady, non-threatening body language, avoiding sudden movements or splashing, and never touching or pursuing the sharks. Divers are also advised to stay close to the group and listen to the dive leaderâ€™s instructions at all times. The experience offers a unique, awe-inspiring connection with these incredible predators in their natural environment, allowing divers to observe their grace and curiosity up close while promoting understanding and conservation.</p>
